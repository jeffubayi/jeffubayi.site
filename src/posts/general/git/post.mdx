It's such a waste of time and energy to have git-ignorant co-worker. Read the damn manual.
A good place to get started with git is [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

***What is git?***

![understand](./git.jpeg)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

With Git it‚Äôs easy to undo changes back and forth with a precise explanation of the changes that are made. It has the ability of:

- Keeping a track of the changes i.e. different versions of the same file.

- It also keeps a record of all the files present in a project.

- Comparing and analyzing different codes with a detailed explanation.

Making a pull request

Pull Request (PR) is a Github feature that allows users to collaborate better together. Usually in source control software there is a main branch that describes production‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin git it is the master branch. One can create a feature branch and make changes there, then issue a PR to the master branch for someone else to review, approve or reject the changes and merge to the master branch eventually. Discussing potential improvements is crucial to write and maintain a high quality repository.

Now PR is a Github feature, but it relies on the git feature named `request-pull`. Git supports PRs by providing a feature that lets you request a pull from one working set to another from different branches or different repositories. The command lets you review a summarise of the feature branch with all the commits and changes that are going to be merged. When working with PRs it is recommended to work in a feature branch and not on the master and make PRs to the master.
