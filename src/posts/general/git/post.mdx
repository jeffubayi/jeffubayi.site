It's such a waste of time and energy to have git-ignorant co-worker. Read the damn manual.
A few tips on how I go about using git.

***What is git?***

![understand](./git.jpeg)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

With Git it’s easy to undo changes back and forth with a precise explanation of the changes that are made. It has the ability of:

- Keeping a track of the changes i.e. different versions of the same file.

- It also keeps a record of all the files present in a project.

- Comparing and analyzing different codes with a detailed explanation.
