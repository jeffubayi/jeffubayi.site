Have you ever wondered how open-source libraries built by companies come into existence?

I've always been curious about it. Do they start with the intention of creating an internal library? Is open-source the initial goal? If neither, how does it happen at all? Now that I've been lucky enough to see that through from start to finish, it feels worth sharing the story of how [Refract](https://refract.js.org) came to exist!
