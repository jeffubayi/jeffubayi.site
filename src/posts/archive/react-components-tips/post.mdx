Component-based Development has taken the FrontEnd Development by storm.

And Components not being any language standard, there are many ways to Create and Use Components.

Here are some tips to help you with Component Driven Development.

These are not limited to modern frameworks like Angular, VueJS, React. These tips will help in any Component Driven Development/Setup.


## 1. Composition.

Try to imagine a component (ComponentA) having three Child Components (ComponentA1, ComponentA2, ComponentA3). Each of them need different data to render.

And for all three child components, you need to pass data through Parent Component.

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const dataA = {}, dataB = {}, dataC = {};
  const handleClickA = () => {};
  const handleClickB = () => {};
  const handleClickC = () => {};

  return (
    <ComponentA
      dataA={dataA}
      handleClickA={handleClickA}
      dataB={dataB}
      handleClickB={handleClickB}
      dataC={dataC}
      handleClickC={handleClickC}
    />
  );
}

const ComponentA = ({
  dataA,
  dataB,
  dataC,
  handleClickA,
  handleClickB,
  handleClickC
}) => (
  <>
    <ComponentA1 data={dataA} handleClick={handleClickA} />
    <ComponentA2 data={dataB} handleClick={handleClickB} />
    <ComponentA3 data={dataC} handleClick={handleClickC} />
  </>
);

```

With composition, you can rewrite the above arrangement as:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const dataA = {}, dataB = {}, dataC = {};
  const handleClickA = () => {};
  const handleClickB = () => {};
  const handleClickC = () => {};

  return (
    <ComponentA>
      <ComponentA1
        data={dataA}
        handleClick={handleClickA}
      />
      <ComponentA2
        data={dataB}
        handleClick={handleClickB}
      />
      <ComponentA3
        data={dataC}
        handleClick={handleClickC}
      />
    </ComponentA>
  );
}

const ComponentA = ({children}) => (
  <>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    {children}
  </>
);

```

## 2. Extract complex logic as functions.

Any complex logic that can take an input and provided an output should be extracted as functions. Benefits to extract logic as function are:

 - Extracted logic become Pure Functions
 - Testable Functions
 - Better Code reusability
 - Components stay small without Logic
 - Easy for Code Review
 - Components only need to be tested for interactivity

## 3. Utilize CSS wherever possible

Functionalities like Hover actions, Basic Transitions/Animations look very lucrative to achieve with JavaScript. But consider utilizing CSS for these functionalities.

CSS can achieve some functionalities very easily as compared to JS. Use CSS to your benefit.

```javascript

const App = () => {
  const [hovered, setHover] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Component
      className="container"
      onMouseEenter={() => setHover(true)}
      onMouseEenter={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <Contact hovered={hovered} />
    </ComponentA>
  );
}

const Contact = ({hovered}) => {
  if (!hovered) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <a href="mailto:jeffubayi@gmail.com">Contact Us</a>
  );
}

```
You can rewrite above components as:
```javascript

const App = () => {
  const [hovered, setHover] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Component
      className="container"
      onMouseEenter={() => setHover(true)}
      onMouseEenter={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      We provide User Interface Development Services
      <Contact className="contact-link"/>
    </ComponentA>
  );
}

const Contact = () => (
  <a href="mailto:info@time2hack.com">Contact Us</a>
);

```
With styles defined in SCSS as:

```javascript
.container {
  display: block;

  .contact-link {
    display: none;
  }

  &:hover .contact-link {
    display: block; /* or any other visible display */
  }
}
```

With CSS, re-render of component is not needed.  
> Virtual Diff vdiff of DOM is very small (change of CSS class). Hence the UI is much 
> more responsive on user events

## 4. Separation of Concern

Code blocks should only do what they were intended to do.

Adding more conditions and parameters can make them lengthy and hard to debug and test.

Take for example from the code block above, the ContactUs  component,

```javascript

const Contact = ({hovered}) => {
  if (!hovered) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <a href="mailto:jeffubayi@gmail.com">Contact Us</a>
  );
}
```

Here it is more dependent on hovered prop values for render. Which means this Component needs testing for the various cases of hovered prop.

In this case, it is a boolean prop but it will multiply in case of complex object props.

We can rewrite the component to remove the dependency on the hovered prop.

The Container component should own the concern of render/no-render with itself.

Contact Component’s job is to render Contact Us button/link. Expecting it to do more logical things will introduce more edge cases.

We can either use CSS to handle hide and show the button on Hover; as we saw in the previous section.

Or, conditionally render Contact component from the parent component, which is as follows:

```javascript

const App = () => {
  const [hovered, setHover] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Component
      onMouseEenter={() => setHover(true)}
      onMouseEenter={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      We provide User Interface Development Services
      {hovered && <Contact />}
    </ComponentA>
  );
}

const Contact = () => (
  <a href="jeffubayi@gmail.com">Contact Us</a>
);

```
 ## 5. Use tools at the disposal

Design Systems, Storybook, unit tests, coverage reports etc. I can go on and list many more tools. But the take away here is “Identify the key tools and get the best out of them”

For example,

 ### Storybook
Storybook is a great tool for building the basic examples and possible combinations. It also helps to build the documentation of Components.

 ### Testing
Unit, Integration, E2E etc. will help you Code and Release with Confidence. Disperse your testing in various strategies and keep it sane.

Test cases provide awesome documentation around restrictions and edge cases. Cover your Code with Tests and Maintain them.

You can use Coverage Reports to get Overview on how much Testing has increased and add Coverage Report labels to PRs on Github

### Linters
Linters will help you write beautiful code and address syntax/code style propblems. These problems usually appear in code reviews if not take care while development.

Style Rules like spacing, code style, function signatures etc are common review comments. Avoiding them from start will help in efficient for Code Reviews.

 ## 6. Code for People 🤝

 Code for application is easy. Code for people is very hard.

Code can be very optimized and hard to read at the same time. Hard to read code can make it prone to much common error related to misunderstanding the code.

Keeping the Lines Small, Easy to Read can lead to better code harmony.

I came across the argument of having a more disciplined team towards Code Structure. This argument is very valid but the code should also be ready for new joiners, be it for Senior Devs to Junior Devs.

Team discipline can be different from the general community discipline. That’s why, Team discipline & community discipline should be with least friction.
