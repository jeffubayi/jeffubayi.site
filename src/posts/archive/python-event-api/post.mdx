Will be making web APIs with the popular python web framework, Django.

You've probably heard that the best way to learn is by doing. So in this walkthrough, we'll be building a RESTful API with Django and the django rest framework. The project will be an event scheduler application, similar to meetup.com.

Key features will be users to create events and other registered users can mark attendance to the created events. We'll also explore how to review an event, putting in place checks to ensure only those members who attended the event can review any given event. Hopefully, by the end of the series, you too can apply some of the concepts here to build your own REST APIs with Django.

You'll find the project's code my [github](https://github.com/jeffubayi/Events-Organizer).

## Introduction and project setup.

- User registration,authetication and authorization with djoser and JSON web tokens(JWTs).
- Events creation and attendance endpoints.

I'll try to follow a similar structure in this. This will mainly involve:

1. Model creation.
2. Serializers, API views and modifying them to suit our needs.
3. Creating permission classes for our endpoints.
4. Writing automated unit tests for the endpoints.
5. Demo with postman.

## Project setup

For this project, we'll need to have python 3+ installed. You can find the necessary steps here.
Next, we'll need to make virtual environments for installing project dependencies.

Install virtualenv

 `pip install virtualenv` 
Create a new virtualenv

 `virtualenv yourenvname -p python3.6`
Activate virtual environment

`source yourenvname/bin/activate`
Run this command within the directory the virtual environment was created in.

## Dependencies

1. Django and the Django rest framework

 `pip install django djangorestframework`
2. Djoser: REST implementation of Django authentication system. The Djoser library provides a set of Django Rest Fr amework views and endpoints to handle basic actions such as registration, login, logout, password reset, and account activation

 `pip install djoser`
3. django-rest-framework-simplejwt: provides a JSON Web Token authentication backend for the Django REST Framework.

`pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt`
Typically, if you have a lot of project dependencies in python, it's advisable to put them in a requirements.txt file and install them with one command.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
To kick off the new django project, run the following once you've activated the previously created virtual environment.

`django-admin startproject eventScheduler`
Now to start with the first app that we'll be requiring for the next section:

`cd eventScheduler`
`python manage.py startapp accounts `

If you've followed the steps along, our app should now be having its structure as

```
./eventScheduler
â”œâ”€â”€ accounts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apps.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrations
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ views.py
â”œâ”€â”€ eventScheduler
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __pycache__
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.cpython-35.pyc
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.cpython-35.pyc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wsgi.py
â””â”€â”€ manage.py
```
