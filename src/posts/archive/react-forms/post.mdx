Building forms in react can be abit cumbersome, Formik intergates so well with react to solve most issues at hand.

> Build forms in react without tears

Formik’s website claims to help you with the most annoying issues of forms:

 1. Getting values in and out of form state
 2. Validation and error messages
 3. Handling form submission

After creating a few forms myself using Formik, I can see how these common issues just disappear. Form values are not stored in state so we don’t need to manually bind them to an input. Instead, Formik keys off the name attribute and does the binding automatically.

There are two ways to use Formik: 
  1. create a higher order component. `useFormik()`
  2. create a Formik component to wrap around your form. `<Formik/>`

When you wrap your form in a Formik component, the child is a function and not a component. This function takes one argument which is a variety of props Formik passes you to manage state. This helps reduce the boilerplate code involved in creating a form by providing the following default props: handleSubmit, handleChange, initialValues, validation and more.

Using Formik has allowed us to create our own reusable form components which were a large factor in our decision to use the library. It makes creating new forms painless and allows us to test them easily.
