### Quick React project setup

**`create-react-app`** is a project aimed at getting you up to speed with React in no time, and any React app that needs to outgrow a single page will find that create-react-app meets that need.
       npx create-react-app todo

       cd todo

       npm start

Navigate to **`localhost 3000`**

 #  Core concepts

### 1. Elements and JSX
An element describes what you see on the screen
The basic syntax for a  React element
```javascript
// In a nutshell, JSX allows us to write HTML in our JS
// JSX can use any valid html tags (i.e. div/span, h1-h6, form/input, etc)
<div>Hello React</div> 
```
**JSX** elements are expressions

```javascript
// as an expression, JSX can be assigned to variables...
const greeting = <div>Hello React</div>;

const isNewToReact = true;

// ... or can be displayed conditionally
function sayGreeting() {
  if (isNewToReact) {
    // ... or returned from functions, etc.
    return greeting; // displays: Hello React
  } else {
    return <div>Hi again, React</div>;
  }
}
```
The slight difference between JSX and HTML syntax include;
```html
// Empty div is not <div></div> (HTML), but <div/> (JSX)
<div/>

// A single tag element like input is not <input> (HTML), but <input/> (JSX)
<input name="email" />

// Attributes are written in camelcase for JSX (like JS variables
<button className="submit-button">Submit</button> // not 'class' (HTML)
```

  The most basic React app requires three things:
  
   -   1. `ReactDOM.render()` to render our app
   -   2. A `JSX element` (called a root node in this context)
    -   3. A `DOM element` within which to mount the app (usually a div with an id of root in an index.html file)

```javascript
// imports needed if using NPM package; not if from CDN links
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const greeting = <h1>Hello React</h1>;

// ReactDOM.render(root node, mounting point)
ReactDOM.render(greeting, document.getElementById("root"));

```

### 2. Components and Props

Components lets you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces in isolation.

####  Function and Class components

Components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
```javascript
// Function Component
import React from "react";

function Header() {
  // function components must be capitalized unlike normal JS functions
  // note the capitalized name here: 'Header'
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}

// function components with arrow functions are also valid
const Header = () => <h1>Hello React</h1>;
```

```javascript
// Class Component
// (classes are another type of function)
import React from  "react";

class Header extends React.Component {
  // class components have more boilerplate (with extends and render method)
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
  }
}

```
Components can be reusable across an app.
```javascript
// for example, this Header component can be reused in any app page

// this component shown for the '/' route
function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <About />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

// shown for the '/blog' route
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Blog />
      <Tags />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```
#### Props

Props /`properties` are Read-only data that is passed dynamically  to components.
```javascript
const username = "Jeff";
// props is the object that every component receives as an argument

function Header(props) {
  // the props we make on the component (i.e. username)
  // become properties on the props object
  return <h1>Hello {props.username}</h1>;
}
```

>All React components must act like `pure functions` with respect to their props.
That is, for every input, we be able to expect the same output




We can also accept react components as props through  special property on the props object called 'children'.
```javascript

function Layout(props) {
  return <div className="container">{props.children}</div>;
}

// The children prop is very useful for when you want the same
// component (such as a Layout component) to wrap all other components:
function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Header />
      <Hero />
      <Footer />
    </Layout>
  );
}

// different page, but uses same Layout component (thanks to children prop)
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <About />
      <Footer />
    </Layout>
  );
}
}

```
**`Fragments`** are special components for displaying multiple components without adding an extra element to the DOM
    -   Fragments are ideal for conditional logic

```javascript
//example
// if isAuthenticated is true, how do we display both AuthLinks and Greeting?
function Header() {
  const isAuthenticated = checkAuth();

  return (
    <nav>
      <Logo />
      {/* we can render both components with a fragment */}
      {/* fragments are very concise: <> </> */}
      {isAuthenticated ? (
        <>
          <AuthLinks />
          <Greeting />
        </>
      ) : (
        <Login />
      )}
    </nav>
  );
}
```
### 3. Lists and keys

We use `map()` to convert a list of data(arrays) into lists of elements

```javascript
const people = ['Jeff', 'Bria', 'Rose'];
const peopleList = people.map(person => {<p> {person} </p>};
```
Each React element iterated over needs a special **`key`** prop

 -   Keys are essential for React to be able to keep track of each element that is being iterated over with map
 -   Without keys, it is harder for it to figure out how elements should be updated when data changes
-    Keys are unique values to represent the fact that these elements are separate from one another
```javascript
function App() {
  const people = ['Jeff', 'Bria', 'Rose'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {/* keys need to be primitive values, ideally a generated id */}
      {people.map(person => <Person key={person} name={person} />)}
    </ul>
  );
}

// If you don't have ids with your set of data or unique primitive values,
// you can use the second parameter of .map() to get each elements index
function App() {
  const people = ['John', 'Bob', 'Fred'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {/* use array element index for key */}
      {people.map((person, i) => <Person key={i} name={person} />)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
### 4. Events and Event Handlers

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements
The most essential React events to know are **`onClick `**  and  **`onChange`**

-   `onClick` handles click events on JSX elements (namely buttons)
-   `onChange` handles keyboard events (namely inputs)
```javascript
function App() {
  function handleChange(event) {
    // when passing the function to an event handler, like onChange
    // we get access to data about the event (an object)
    const inputText = event.target.value;
    const inputName = event.target.name; // myInput
    // we get the text typed in and other data from event.target
  }

  function handleSubmit() {
    // on click doesn't usually need event data
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" name="myInput" onChange={handleChange} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

# React Hooks
### 1. State and useState

**`State`** allows components to create and manage their own data. So unlike props, components cannot pass data with state, but they can create and manage it internally.
```javascript
class Test extends React.Component {    
    constructor() {    
        this.state = {      
            id: 1,      
            name: "test"    
        };  
    }    
    
    render() {    
        return (      
            <div>        
              <p>{this.state.id}</p>        
              <p>{this.state.name}</p>      
            </div>    
        );  
    }
}
```
By importing **`useState`** in your code you're signaling the intent to hold some kind of state inside your React component.

```javascript

import React {useState}from 'react';

// create state variable
// syntax: const [stateVariable] = React.useState(defaultValue);
function App() {
  const [language] = React.useState('javascript');
  // we use array destructuring to declare state variable

  return <div>I am learning {language}</div>;
}
```
#### what happens when state changes
A change in the state happens based on user-input or triggering an event.
Also, React components (with state) are rendered based on the data in the state. State holds the initial information.

>So when state changes, React gets informed and immediately re-renders the DOM –  `not the whole DOM, but only the component with the updated state.`
> This is one of the reasons why React is fast.

### 2. Side effects and useEffect

**`useEffect`** lets us perform side effects in function components.

 **`Side effects`**- are where we need to reach into the outside world. For example, fetching data from an API or working with the DOM.
 
  >Side effects are actions that can change our component state in an unpredictable fashion (that have cause 'side effects').
  
`useEffect` accepts a callback function (called the 'effect' function), which will by default run every time there is a re-render
> useEffect runs once our component mounts, which is the right time to perform a side effect in the component lifecycle

```javascript
// This code picks a color from the colors array
// and makes it the background color
function App() {
  const [colorIndex, setColorIndex] = React.useState(0);
  const colors = ["blue", "green", "red", "orange"];

  // we are performing a 'side effect' since we are working with an API
  // we are working with the DOM, a browser API outside of React
  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = colors[colorIndex];
  });
  // whenever state is updated, App re-renders and useEffect runs

  function handleChangeIndex() {
    const next = colorIndex + 1 === colors.length ? 0 : colorIndex + 1;
    setColorIndex(next);
  }

  return <button onClick={handleChangeIndex}>Change background color</button>;
}

```

 To avoid executing the effect callback after each render, we provide a second argument, an empty array

```javascript
function App() {
  ...
  // now our button doesn't work no matter how many times we click it...
  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = colors[colorIndex];
  }, []);
  // the background color is only set once, upon mount

  // how do we not have the effect function run for every state update...
  // but still have it work whenever the button is clicked?

  return (
    <button onClick={handleChangeIndex}>
      Change background color
    </button>
  );
}

```

`useEffect` lets us conditionally perform effects with the dependencies array
 The dependencies array is the second argument and if any one of the values in the array changes, the effect function runs again

```javascript
function App() {
  const [colorIndex, setColorIndex] = React.useState(0);
  const colors = ["blue", "green", "red", "orange"];

  // we add colorIndex to our dependencies array
  // when colorIndex changes, useEffect will execute the effect fn again
  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = colors[colorIndex];
    // when we use useEffect, we must think about what state values
    // we want our side effect to sync with
  }, [colorIndex]);

  function handleChangeIndex() {
    const next = colorIndex + 1 === colors.length ? 0 : colorIndex + 1;
    setColorIndex(next);
  }

  return <button onClick={handleChangeIndex}>Change background color</button>;
}

```

-   Fetching data with useEffect 
> Note that handling promises with the more concise async/await syntax requires creating a separate function (Why? The effect callback function cannot be async)

```javascript
const endpoint = "https://api.github.com/users/codeartistryio";

// with promises:
function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // promises work in callback
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setUser(data));
  }, []);
}

// with async / await syntax for promise:
function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);
  // cannot make useEffect callback function async
  React.useEffect(() => {
    getUser();
  }, []);

  // instead, use async / await in separate function, then call
  // function back in useEffect
  async function getUser() {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/codeartistryio");
    const data = await response.json();
    setUser(data);
  }
}
```
### 3.Performance and useCallback

**`useCallback`** is a hook that is used for improving our component performance
If you have a component that re-renders frequently, `useCallback` prevents callback functions within the component from being recreated every single time the component re-renders (which mean the function component re-runs)
  `useCallback` re-runs only when one of it's dependencies changes

```javascript
// in Timer, we are calculating the date and putting it in state a lot
// this results in a re-render for every state update

// we had a function handleIncrementCount to increment the state 'count'...
function Timer() {
  const [time, setTime] = React.useState();
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  // ... but unless we wrap it in useCallback, the function is
  // recreated for every single re-render (bad performance hit)
  // useCallback hook returns a callback that isn't recreated every time
  const inc = React.useCallback(
    function handleIncrementCount() {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    },
    // useCallback accepts a second arg of a dependencies array like useEffect
    // useCallback will only run if any dependency changes (here it's 'setCount')
    [setCount]
  );

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      const currentTime = JSON.stringify(new Date(Date.now()));
      setTime(currentTime);
    }, 300);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }, [time]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current time is: {time}</p>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={inc}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

###  4. Memoization and useMemo

**`useMemo`** is very similar to useCallback and is for improving performance, but instead of being for callbacks, it is for storing the results of expensive calculations
`useMemo` allows us to 'memoize', or remember the result of expensive calculations when they have already been made for certain inputs (we already did it once for these values, so no need to do it again)
 `useMemo` returns a value from the computation, not a callback function (but can be a function)

```javascript
// useMemo is useful when we need a lot of computing resources
// to perform an operation, but don't want to repeat it on each re-render

function App() {
  // state to select a word in 'words' array below
  const [wordIndex, setWordIndex] = useState(0);
  // state for counter
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // words we'll use to calculate letter count
  const words = ["i", "am", "learning", "react"];
  const word = words[wordIndex];

  function getLetterCount(word) {
    // we mimic expensive calculation with a very long (unnecessary) loop
    let i = 0;
    while (i < 1000000) i++;
    return word.length;
  }

  // Memoize expensive function to return previous value if input was the same
  // only perform calculation if new word without a cached value
  const letterCount = React.useMemo(() => getLetterCount(word), [word]);

  // if calculation was done without useMemo, like so:

  // const letterCount = getLetterCount(word);

  // there would be a delay in updating the counter
  // we would have to wait for the expensive function to finish

  function handleChangeIndex() {
    // flip from one word in the array to the next
    const next = wordIndex + 1 === words.length ? 0 : wordIndex + 1;
    setWordIndex(next);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {word} has {letterCount} letters
      </p>
      <button onClick={handleChangeIndex}>Next word</button>
      <p>Counter: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

### 5. Refs and useRef

`Refs` are a special attribute that are available on all React components. They allow us to create a reference to a given element / component when the component mounts.
`useRef` allows us to easily use React refs
   -   We call useRef (at top of component) and attach the returned value to the element's ref attribute to refer to it
    -   Once we create a reference, we use the current property to modify (mutate) the element's properties or can call any available methods on that element (like .focus() to focus an input)

```javascript
function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState("react hooks");
  // we can pass useRef a default value
  // we don't need it here, so we pass in null to ref an empty object
  const searchInput = useRef(null);

  function handleClearSearch() {
    // current references the text input once App mounts
    searchInput.current.value = "";
    // useRef can store basically any value in its .current property
    searchInput.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <input
        type="text"
        onChange={event => setQuery(event.target.value)}
        ref={searchInput}
      />
      <button type="submit">Search</button>
      <button type="button" onClick={handleClearSearch}>
        Clear
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

There are many other React concepts to learn, but these are the ones I believe you must know before any others to set you on the path to React mastery in 2020.
